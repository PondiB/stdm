<h1>What's New in STDM Version 1.7?</h1>
<p>STDM 1.7 is a full release which includes new features, enhanced functionality and stability improvements. One of the key highlights is the integration with GeoODK where STDM data profiles can be directly exported to ODK XForms specification. Other changes include additional options for customizing a data profile&rsquo;s social tenure relationship; the ability to change the order of<strong>&nbsp;Entities</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Columns</strong>; better integration with QGIS Attribute Table and styling, major bug fixes to the <strong>Documents Designer</strong>; inclusion of three document template samples for the three sample STDM profiles; minor enhancements and bug fixes throughout the whole STDM modules and; stability improvement to support STDM handle forms and data in non-English languages. The user interface has been translated to French, Portuguese, Arabic and German.
</p>
<p>We would like to thank our partners and everyone else who supported the development, documentation, testing and translation of the tool. In a special way, we would like to acknowledge:

<p >The following sections summarize the new features in STDM 1.7.
</p>

<h1 >Mobile Support</h1>
<p >Mobile data collection is supported as a new feature in this release. GeoODK, ODK and Kobo Collect application can now be used for data collection with forms generated from STDM data model (profile). This generated form conforms to the ODK standard and XFORM syntax supporting a wide collection of attributes such text, pictures, geographic data, list, numbers, barcodes e.tc. 
</p>

        style="width:100%; max-width: 457.00px;"></p>
<p >A <strong >Generate Mobile Form</strong>&nbsp;command provide an interface that immediately convert the current STDM profile into a mobile data collection form.
</p>
<p ><img

        style="width:100%; max-width: 410.50px; "
        title=""></p>
<p >Additionally, the collected data can be imported into STDM using mobile data import wizard in a simple interface that pulls data from mobile device into STDM database.
</p>
<p ></p>
<p >Mobile support enhances the power of STDM creating a shift from pen and paper data collection so that data can be electronically collected using mobile devices and transferred into STDM in a simple user friendly interface. The mobile applications are freely available from Google Play. The user will only need to create STDM profile then go to generate mobile form. Once generate, the form can be uploaded to mobile via USB cable to the application folder in the mobile device or fetched from an Aggregate server hosted within the network and data collection can ensure from there.
</p>
<p >The are several advantages that comes with this feature. 
</p>
<p >The complex mobile data template design process is made easier. 
</p>
<p >The forms are generated from the existing STDM profile that reflects STDM database.
</p>
<p >Easily to integrate field data with the STDM database back in the office or over the network
</p>
<h1 >Database Configuration</h1>
<h2 >Entity Label</h2>
<p >Entities can now have customized labels. The labels can be more descriptive and user friendly than the entity names hence making the purpose of an entity to a user clearer.
</p>
<p ><img
        alt="" src="images/image14.png"
        style="width:100%; max-width: 617.00px; "
        title=""></p>
<h2 >Entities and Column Ordering
</h2>
<p >With STDM 1.7 it is now possible to change the order of created entities and columns by simply dragging and dropping. The creation order for entities has an effect on how entities appear on the STDM menu, while the columns creation order reflects on how they appear on the forms.
</p>
<h2 >&nbsp;Label
</h2>
<p >Labeling of columns on a form is now easily customizable. You can now choose which label will appear next to a column field on a generated form. Normally, a label of a column is auto-generated from the value entered in&nbsp;Column Name&nbsp;field when creating columns. &nbsp;Now, with version 1.7, a new field called &nbsp;in the column editor allows you to change that behavior by letting you enter a value that will be used as a column label on the auto-generated form, see image below.
</p>

        title=""></p>
<h2 >Defining Social Tenure Relationship
</h2>
<h3 >Multiple Spatial Units 
</h3>
<p >Defining Social Tenure Relationship in the configuration wizard now has been improved to allow multiple spatial units for a single party or multiple parties. Prior to this, it was only possible to have a single spatial unit participating in a social tenure relationship.
</p>
<p ><img
        alt="" src="images/image16.png"
        style="width:100%; max-width: 624.00px;"
        title=""></p>
<h2 >Spatial Unit Specific Tenure Type
</h2>
<p >For cases where you have multiple spatial units, it is now possible to assign different tenure type for each spatial unit participating in a Social Tenure Relationship.
</p>

        alt="" src="images/image7.png"
        style="width:100%; max-width: 624.00px;"
        title=""></p>
<h2 >Custom Tenure Information</h2>
<p >To add more flexibility to tenure information, STDM 1.7 adds a new feature that allows a user to add extra custom attributes to different tenure types when configuring a profile. Example of such custom attributes on tenure types would include added information on a disputed property ownership. For more details, see the main system documentation.

<h1 >Social Tenure Relationship Modules
</h1>
<h2 >Social Tenure Relationship (STR) Editor
</h2>
<h3 >Multiple Spatial Unit Entities 
</h3>
<p >With ability to choose more than one <strong
        >Spatial Units</strong>&nbsp;in the <strong
        >Configuration</strong>, the <strong >Social Tenure Relationship</strong>&nbsp;editor has added support to switch between Spatial Units to select spatial unit records. This is very useful when a profile contains more than one properties such as parcel and structure, farm and house, etc. The image below shows the Spatial Unit drop down menu. 
</p>
<p ><img
        alt="" src="images/image5.png"
        style="width:100%; max-width: 960px;"
        title=""></p>
<h3 >Custom Tenure Information</h3>
<p >
    Another major addition to STDM 1.7 is the ability to add <strong
        >Custom Tenure Information </strong>that provides more freedom to add additional fields related to tenure. Consequently, the <strong
        >Custom Tenure Information</strong>&nbsp;form is added in <strong
        >Social Tenure Relationship editor </strong>as shown below. 
</p>
<p ><img
        alt="" src="images/image8.png"
        style="width:100%; max-width: 960px;"
        title=""></p>
<h2 >View Social Tenure Relationship
</h2>
<p >The View Social Tenure Relationship has benefited from an improved performance with internal changes to the search query and display. There is a noticeable change in querying speed but not a significant change in the result box as shown in the image below. 
</p>
<p ><img
        alt="" src="images/image12.png"
        style="width:100%; max-width: 394px;"
        title=""></p>
<p >The noticeable addition is the <strong >Custom Tenure Information</strong>&nbsp;under <strong
        >Social Tenure Relationship </strong>item. </p>
<h1 >Spatial Unit Manager</h1>
<h2 >QGIS Attribute Table and Styling STDM Layers
</h2>
<p >A better integration is done with QGIS to style STDM layers using Lookup, Related Entity, and Administrative Unit columns. Previously these columns were showing ids of the parent table. By joining the parent tables to STDM layers, it is possible to show the values when in QGIS Attribute Table and under Layer Properties when styling layers. When styling using Lookup, Related Entity, and Administrative Unit columns make sure you use the columns followed by &ldquo;Value&rdquo; suffix as shown in the image below. </p>
<p ><img
        alt="" src="images/image2.png"
        style="width:100%; max-width: 835px;"
        title=""></p>
<h2 >Spatial Entity Editor</h2>
<p >The GPS Importer is enabled by default to allow users to adding and editing a record from the Entity Browser. This reduces complication in for users as they are no longer required to add and select the layer to which the data is added. Editing saved GPS feature is now possible which is very useful when a wrong feature is imported. Users can just edit a record and import the correct one to replace the geometry saved earlier&nbsp;(see the image below).</p>
<p ><img
        alt="" src="images/image17.png"
        style="width:100%; max-width: 476.27px;"
        title=""></p>
<h1 >Documents Designer</h1>
<h2 >Sample Templates
</h2>
<p >To make it easy for users to understand and design templates, new sample templates are incorporated. These templates can be customized in Documents Designer and used. Their names corresponds to the spatial units of each profiles. 
</p>
<p >
    The following templates are added into the template folder&nbsp;automatically:</p>
<ul >
    <li ><strong >certificate_of_structure_occupancy_sample</strong>&nbsp;- Informal Settlement Profile</li>
    <li ><strong
            >certificate_of_parcel_ownership_sample</strong>&nbsp;- Local Government Profile</li>
    <li ><strong
            >certificate_of_garden_occupancy_sample</strong>&nbsp;- Rural Agriculture Profile</li>
</ul>
<h2 >Saving Template</h2>
<p >In the previous versions of STDM, clicking on the save button results in a dialog asking the user to write the file name even though a file name is provided in the previous save. In STDM 1.7, a dialog is no longer shown if the file is saved. Instead the saved changes are applied in the same file. 
</p>
<h2 >Styling and Text Wrapping in Data Labels
</h2>
<p >
    It is now possible to style and apply text wrapping on<strong
        >&nbsp;Data labels </strong>using HTML. To apply HTML, <strong
        >Render as HTML</strong>&nbsp;checkbox needs to be checked. Text wrapping is already possible in Attribute Table using the <strong
        >Appearance </strong>options under <strong
        >Item </strong>properties. &nbsp;</p>
<p ><img
        alt="" src="images/image11.jpg"
        style="width:100%; max-width: 408.50px;"
        title=""></p>
<p >The above code looks like the following on the generated document. 
</p>
<p ><img
        alt="" src="images/image4.png"
        style="width:100%; max-width: 317.50px;"
        title=""></p>
<h2 >Adding Text in Data Labels</h2>
<p >Users can now add text that acts as a label to the data label by adding it in front or after the data label. This reduces the number of items added to the template, which makes it easier to align, re-size, move items, etc. The image below shows example implementation. &nbsp;
</p>
<p ><img
        alt="" src="images/image13.png"
        style="width:100%; max-width: 532.00px;"
        title=""></p>
<h1 >Documents Generator</h1>
<p >A useful button is added to the Documents Generator. This button enables users to open the output folder. The image below highlights the button. 
</p>
<p ><img
        alt="" src="images/image10.png"
        style="width:100%; max-width: 549px;"
        title=""></p>
<h1 >General</h1>
<h2 >Software Packages
</h2>
<p >The all-in-one installer for STDM 1.7 is built upon the following packages: PostgreSQL v9.6, PostGIS 2.2 and QGIS 2.18. STDM is also compatible with QGIS 2.14 and 2.16. See the links below for the full list of feature updates in QGIS.
