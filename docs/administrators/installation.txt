What to know before installing
==============================
What do I need to install to have a fully functional STDM?
----------------------------------------------------------
For a fully functional STDM, the following packages are bundled together
with the installer.

* Quantum GIS (current version 2.8.2)
* PostgreSQL (current version 9.4.2)
* PostGIS  (current version 2.1.7)
* Sample data is optional if you want to have a sample data to manipulate and test features of STDM.

Do I need to uninstall previous installation of the above software?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is not necessary especially if you are working with QGIS 2.6 or higher
and postgres 8.4 or higher.

In this case, you need to do the following:

* Start QGIS normally and wait for it to load
* Download the latest version of STDM plugin from `STDM Pluging Repository <http://stdm.gltn.net/plugin/plugins.xml>`_ by adding STDM download repository in the QGIs Plugin manager. See instructions :ref:`installing-from-stdm-plugin-repository`
* Using postgreSQL database browser i.e pgadmin create a new database called stdm.
* Within stdm database, create postgis extension.
* On the QGIS window, check if STDM is enable on the menu and toolbar |stdm_tool_bar|
* Delete previous config files in the the working directory.
* Login and configure data forms wizard to finish.

Upgrade your configuration file
-------------------------------
.. note:: This only applies if you are running stdm version 1.0.

The current version has rich and improved features that have also been
changed in the configuration file. It is recommended to remove previous
config file in your workspace so that the improved configuration can be copied.

.. warning:: Duplicate keys for the modules exits:

This error is mostly attribute to mismatch of config file and especially
where new module were created to replace the existing ones. To remove this
error, you either restore the original config files or simply ask
administrator to run pgadmin and open stdm database, then truncate all the
values in the content base and content roles tables. The problem should be fixed.

Using Bundled STDM installer
============================

The bundled installer is the custom installer that is built to help you
easily install stdm and dependent software packages.

.. note:: **32bit machine** please select and run STDM-1.1-Final-x86.exe setup file, **64bit machines** run STDM-1.1-Final-x86_64.exe setup file.

Installtion steps
-----------------

Step 1
------
* Run the installer by double clicking on setup file and select ‘Next’.

Step 3
------
* Choose the components you would like to install, the following are the available components;

* **QGIS Wein 2.8.2 for STDM** – This will install QGIS with STDM plugin embedded
* **PostgreSQL 9.4** – This will install PostgreSQL database server, if you don’t have PostgreSQL make sure you select this option, STDM will not work without it.
* **PostGIS 2.1.7** – This install the GIS plugin for PostgreSQL, if you don’t have it in your machine make sure you select for installation.
* **Sample data** – This will install sample files for STDM plugin. This is not a mandatory option, but new users are recommended to install to help them jump start with STDM practice.

After your selection, click ‘Next’ to start the installation.

.. note:: If you already have PostgreSQL or PostGIS installed, the installer will skip installation of those components.

Step 4
------
Database connection properties.

*The window allows you to set the username and password to use with STDM.
Leave the default port to 5433, this is where PostgreSQL server will be
listening for database connections (for more details on `PostgreSQL
connections refer to documentation <http://www.postgresql.org>`)*

Step 5
------
This is the actual component installation. QGIS, STDM, PostgreSQL, PostGIS
and all other dependencies will be installed in ‘C:\Program Files\ QGIS Wein for STDM’ folder. Depending on the speed of your machine, this process might take slightly about 15 minutes.

your computer desktop.
