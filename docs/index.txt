==============================================
Welcome to STDM Documentation!
==============================================

The Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) is a pro-poor, gender responsive and
participatory land information system developed by the Global Land Tool
Network  (GLTN). It is one of eighteen land tools being developed,  tested
and applied by GLTN partners to promote secure land and property rights for
all.

STDM has four inter-related components:

#.  A new way of thinking about land records
#.  A free and open-source software package to record information about land
#.  An approach of collecting data about land
#.  A way of using and disseminating information about land
